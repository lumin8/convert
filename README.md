# Data
It's all about the data.  CRUD, with conversion into the filetypes necessary for the DeepAR client apps.

## Sample
useful for testing, the sample data is in UTM z11N.

Data needs to be
- converted to a standard projection (what does Unity use?)
- converted to dxf or other as needed (what does Unity need?)

At this time, data is just in 3D point structure (x,y,z with attributes)
